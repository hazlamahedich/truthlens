# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for TruthLens, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications.

### Starter Template or Existing Project
*   We will use the **Vercel Next.js Enterprise Boilerplate** as the foundation for this project. It provides a pre-configured monorepo with CI/CD, TypeScript, and best practices aligned with our Vercel deployment target. We will then add our FastAPI backend as a new application within this monorepo structure.
*   **Mitigation:** A new story, "Adopt & Clean Starter Template," will be added to Epic 1 to ensure the team familiarizes themselves with the template, updates dependencies, removes unused code, and creates a proof-of-concept for Python integration.
