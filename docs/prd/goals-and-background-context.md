# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
*   To validate that users find value in a news summarization tool that offers integrated blockchain-based source verification.
*   To prove that interactive tools for exploring bias lead to higher user engagement and trust compared to static summaries.
*   To build a foundational, modular platform with an agentic architecture that can be easily extended with new technologies and features in the future.
*   To achieve an initial user base of 1,000 monthly active "Skeptical Verifiers" who demonstrate high retention rates.

## Background Context
The current media landscape is characterized by information overload and declining trust due to opaque biases and the proliferation of misinformation. Existing news aggregators fail to solve this as they typically only group articles, leaving the burden of verification and bias detection on the user. TruthLens addresses this gap by providing an integrated solution that automates source verification via the blockchain and allows users to interactively explore different viewpoints. This PRD outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) intended to prove the core value of this approach.
