# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The UX should be immersive and opinionated, evoking the feeling of a **"digital detective's toolkit" or a "hacker's analysis console."** It must feel powerful and specialized, while remaining clear and usable. The goal is to build trust through a distinct, transparent, and controllable interface, moving beyond a generic "minimalist" aesthetic.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
*   **Query First:** The user journey begins with a clear, singular action: asking a question or providing a URL.
*   **Interactive Exploration:** The core of the app is not a static results page, but an interactive dashboard where users can manipulate the output via the bias slider.
*   **Drill-Down for Proof:** Users should always be one click away from the original source article and the blockchain verification record for any claim.

## Core Screens and Views (Revised MVP)
*   **Home/Query Screen:** A simple page with a prominent input field for text or URL queries.
*   **Results View:** The main screen displaying the generated "Debate Format" summary, the bias slider, and the highlighted text.
*   *(A dedicated 'Source List View' is deferred post-MVP. Source links will be accessible directly from the Results View.)*

## Accessibility
*   The application should meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards.

## Branding
*   The branding will align with the **"digital detective/hacker" theme**. This suggests a potentially darker theme with vibrant accent colors used for data visualization and highlighting. The goal is a unique and memorable identity.

## Target Platforms
*   The application will be designed with a **Mobile-First** philosophy. The core user experience will be perfected on mobile browsers first, and then adapted for larger desktop screens.
