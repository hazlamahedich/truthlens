**Session Goals:** A "sky's the limit" exploration of new features and possibilities for the TruthLens app, starting from a detailed project brief.

**Techniques Used:**
*   Progressive Flow (Divergence -> Convergence)
*   Mind Mapping (for idea generation)
*   Feature Prioritization (for categorization)

## Idea Categorization

The following ideas were generated and then categorized into the project roadmap.

### 1. Part of the MVP (Immediate Opportunities)

*   **URL Input for Article Analysis:** Allow users to input a URL to have the app analyze and summarize a specific article.
*   **Expanded Retrieval Sources:** The retrieval agent will source information not just from news APIs, but also from academic journals, government publications, and public financial datasets, constrained by free and legal access.
*   **"Debate Format" Summary:** An output option that presents key arguments from opposing sides, quoting sources directly.
*   **"Venn Diagram" Summary:** A visual output option showing the overlapping "common ground" of facts between two sides, and the unique claims of each.
*   **Topic-Specific Bias Sliders:** In addition to a political slider, provide sliders relevant to the topic (e.g., "Pro-Industry vs. Pro-Environment"). Each slider position must have a clear explanation.

### 2. Phase 2 Features (Future Innovations)

*   **Voice Query:** Allow users to speak their queries instead of typing.
*   **Advanced Content Highlighting:** Expand highlighting beyond Fact/Opinion to include categories for "Future Prediction" and "Attribution" (showing who made a claim).

### 3. Moonshots (Ambitious, Long-Term Concepts)

*   **Image Capture (OCR) of Physical Articles:** Allow users to take a picture of a physical newspaper or magazine, have the app convert it to text, and then analyze it.
