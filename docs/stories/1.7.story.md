# Story 1.7: Activate Verification

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user of TruthLens,
**I want** the system to replace the mocked Verification agent with real verification logic and display "Verified"/"Unverified" status in the UI,
**so that** I can see the authenticity status of news sources retrieved by the system

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The mocked Verification agent is replaced with real logic (initially mocked as per NFR7)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.6 completion:
- Successful agent-based pattern established with feature flags and comprehensive error handling
- Google Gemini API integration demonstrated robust LLM integration approach
- Feature flag architecture proven: `ENABLE_REAL_SUMMARIZATION` with safe defaults and graceful fallbacks
- Performance benchmarks achieved (<15s for LLM, <1s for mocks)
- Comprehensive testing approach (31 tests) provides solid foundation for quality assurance
- Agent-based serverless functions work well with independent development and testing

### Data Models
The Verification agent must maintain the Source data model structure:
```typescript
interface Source {
  url: string;
  title: string;
  isVerified: boolean; // This field is set by Verification agent
  biasScore?: number; // Future use - can be omitted
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Source]

Key requirement: The verification agent receives Source objects from Retrieval agent and returns the same objects with `isVerified` field populated.

### API Specifications
The Verification agent is called by the Orchestrator in the main sequence:
- Orchestrator calls: `Verification.verify_articles(list_of_sources)`
- Verification returns: Updated Source objects with `isVerified` boolean populated
- Per NFR7: Initial implementation should set `isVerified: false` for all sources (mock behavior)
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#Main Query Sequence Diagram]

### Component Specifications
Frontend must display verification status within summary components:
- Each source should show verification indicator (badge, icon, or text)
- Styling should clearly differentiate verified vs unverified sources
- Handle unknown/error states gracefully
- Compatible with both 'debate' and 'venn_diagram' summary formats
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Summary]

### File Locations
Based on the unified project structure:
- Verification agent implementation: `apps/api/verification.py`
- Frontend components: `apps/web/` (specific component paths to be determined during implementation)
- Shared types (if needed): `packages/shared-types/`
- Tests location: `apps/api/tests/` (pytest) and `apps/web/tests/` (Vitest)
- Environment configuration: `apps/api/.env.example` and Vercel environment variables
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Framework: Pytest for backend (version 7.4.x or higher), Vitest for frontend
- Testing approach: Unit and integration tests required
- Backend testing pattern established in previous stories provides template
- Frontend testing should validate UI state changes for verification status
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - Backend Testing: Pytest, Frontend Testing: Vitest]

### Technical Constraints
- Backend Language: Python 3.11
- Backend Framework: FastAPI (latest)
- Frontend: TypeScript 5.x, Next.js 14.x, React
- Deployment: Vercel Serverless Functions
- Must work within Vercel free tier limits
- Verification logic initially mocked per NFR7 (blockchain integration comes later)
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Technical Summary]

### Architecture Context
- Agent-Based Modules pattern: Verification agent as independent, stateless serverless function
- Orchestrator coordinates between Retrieval → Verification → Summarization sequence
- Each agent maintains separation of concerns and independent deployment capability
- Verification Agent connects to external blockchain/verification services (future implementation)
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Architectural Patterns]
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#High Level Architecture Diagram]

### Project Structure Notes
The monorepo structure uses:
- `apps/` directory for deployable applications (`web` frontend, `api` backend)
- `packages/` for shared code (types, UI components)
- Turborepo for monorepo management following Vercel boilerplate
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Repository Structure]

### Feature Flag Architecture
Following established pattern from Story 1.6:
- Environment variable: `ENABLE_REAL_VERIFICATION=true/false`
- Default to `false` (disabled) for safety - uses mock verification
- When disabled: Always returns `isVerified: false` per NFR7
- When enabled: Calls actual verification logic (blockchain/external service)
- Configuration through Vercel environment variables dashboard
- Clear documentation for different environments (dev, staging, prod)

### NFR7 Compliance
**Critical Requirement**: Per NFR7, the verification implementation must initially set `isVerified: false` for all sources:
- This is not a "mock" but the actual business logic for this story
- Real blockchain verification will be implemented in future stories
- UI must display "Unverified" status for all sources in this initial implementation
- Feature flag allows easy transition to real verification in future

### UI Design Considerations
**Verification Status Display:**
- **Verified Sources**: Green checkmark icon or "✓ Verified" badge
- **Unverified Sources**: Gray/red icon or "⚠ Unverified" text
- **Unknown/Error Status**: Question mark icon with "Status Unknown"
- **Styling**: Use existing Tailwind CSS classes, consistent with shadcn/ui design system
- **Placement**: Near source title/URL in summary display
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels for screen readers

### Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

#### Verification Agent Edge Cases
1. **Empty Source List**
   - Valid scenario from Orchestrator
   - Return empty list without errors
   - Handle gracefully without external calls

2. **Invalid Source Objects**
   - Validate Source object structure on input
   - Handle missing url/title fields gracefully
   - Log validation errors, don't fail entire verification process

3. **Verification Service Timeout/Error (Future)**
   - For current story: N/A since using mock logic
   - Framework should handle timeouts gracefully
   - Default to `isVerified: false` on any error

#### Frontend UI Edge Cases
1. **Missing Verification Status**
   - Default to showing "Status Unknown" if `isVerified` field missing
   - Graceful degradation without breaking summary display

2. **Verification Status Rendering Across Formats**
   - Both 'debate' and 'venn_diagram' formats must show verification status
   - Maintain consistent visual treatment regardless of summary format

3. **Large Number of Sources**
   - Verification status display should not overwhelm UI
   - Consider condensed view for many sources

#### Feature Flag Edge Cases
1. **Feature Flag Disabled (Expected Behavior)**
   - Return `isVerified: false` for all sources (NFR7 compliance)
   - Log flag state for monitoring
   - No error condition - this is normal operation

2. **Feature Flag Configuration Missing**
   - Default to disabled (false) state for safety
   - Log configuration warning
   - Continue with mock behavior

### Performance Benchmarks
1. **Verification Response Time Targets**
   - Mock verification: < 100ms (simple field assignment)
   - Feature flag check: < 10ms
   - Source object processing: < 50ms per source
   - Total Verification agent response: < 500ms

2. **Quality Targets**
   - Source object integrity: No data loss or corruption
   - Field population: 100% accurate `isVerified` field setting
   - Error rate: < 1% for valid inputs

3. **UI Performance Targets**
   - Verification status rendering: < 50ms additional time
   - No impact on summary display performance
   - Responsive design maintained across devices

## Testing

### Testing Standards
