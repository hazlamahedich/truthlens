# Story 1.4: Activate the Query

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to type a query into a text box and see a result,
**so that** I can get a verifiable summary of the topic I'm interested in.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A user can type a query into a real UI text box.
2. The frontend calls the backend with the query.
3. The backend returns a mocked summary.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1): Create the frontend UI.
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Add a text input and a button to the main page in `apps/web`.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Style the components using `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2): Implement the frontend logic.
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create a state variable to hold the query text.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: On button click, send a POST request to `/api/query`.
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Display the response from the backend.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3): Create the backend endpoint.
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create a new file in `apps/api` for the `/api/query` endpoint.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Implement the FastAPI endpoint to accept the query.
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Return a hardcoded, mocked `Summary` object.

## Dev Notes

### Note on Serena Test Suite
The `serena` project's test suite is currently broken due to a Python version incompatibility. Tests should be run ignoring the `serena/test` directory (`pytest --ignore=serena/test`).

### Frontend
- Create a simple UI with a text input and a button in `apps/web` directory.
- Use `shadcn/ui` for the input and button components.
- On button click, make a POST request to `/api/query` with the query text.
- Display the returned summary.

### Backend
- Create a new FastAPI endpoint at `/api/query` in the `apps/api` directory.
- This endpoint should accept a POST request with a JSON body containing the query text.
- It should return a mocked `Summary` object (as defined in `data-models.md`).

### Data Models
- The request body should contain a `queryText` field.
- The response body should be a `Summary` object.

### Source References
- `[Source: architecture/data-models.md]`
- `[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]`
- `[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]`

### Testing
- **Frontend:**
  - Unit test the component to ensure the input and button work correctly.
  - Use Vitest and React Testing Library.
- **Backend:**
  - Unit test the `/api/query` endpoint to ensure it returns the correct mocked data.
  - Use `pytest`.
- **E2E:**
  - Create a Playwright test to simulate a user typing a query and seeing the mocked result.
