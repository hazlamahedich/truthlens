# Story 1.5: Activate Retrieval

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user of TruthLens,
**I want** the system to retrieve real news articles from a configured news API,
**so that** I can get summaries based on actual news content rather than mocked data

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Retrieval agent is built to handle a list of news APIs
2. The Retrieval agent is configured with one live API
3. The rest of the pipeline remains mocked

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Set up Retrieval Agent Structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create retrieval agent file at `apps/api/retrieval.py` following FastAPI patterns
  - [x] Define agent interface that accepts query parameters
  - [x] Set up configuration structure for multiple news APIs
  - [x] Implement error handling for API failures
- [x] Task 2: Implement News API Integration (AC: 2)
  - [x] Select and configure one news API (Recommended: NewsAPI.org for robust free tier with 100 requests/day, comprehensive documentation, and multiple endpoints)
  - [x] Create API client with proper authentication headers
  - [x] Implement fetch_articles function that calls the news API
  - [x] Parse and transform API response to match expected Source data model
- [x] Task 3: Configure API Credentials Management (AC: 2)
  - [x] Set up environment variables for API key in Vercel
  - [x] Add local .env configuration for development
  - [x] Document the secure configuration process
- [x] Task 4: Integrate with Orchestrator (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Update Orchestrator to call real Retrieval agent instead of mock
  - [x] Ensure proper data format is passed between agents
  - [x] Keep Summarization and Verification agents mocked as per AC 3
- [x] Task 5: Add Unit Tests
  - [x] Write pytest tests for Retrieval agent with mocked API responses
  - [x] Test error handling scenarios (API down, rate limits, invalid responses)
  - [x] Test data transformation to Source model
- [x] Task 6: Add Integration Tests
  - [x] Test Orchestrator-Retrieval integration
  - [x] Verify end-to-end flow with real API (use test/sandbox API key if available)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story implementation exists as this is the first story being implemented.

### Data Models
The Retrieval agent must return data matching the Source data model:
```typescript
interface Source {
  url: string;
  title: string;
  isVerified: boolean; // From blockchain check - set to false for now
  biasScore?: number; // Future use - can be omitted
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Source]

Multiple Source objects will be part of the Summary structure:
```typescript
interface Summary {
  format: 'debate' | 'venn_diagram';
  content: any; // Flexible structure for different formats
  sources: Source[];
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Summary]

### API Specifications
The Retrieval agent is called by the Orchestrator as shown in the sequence:
- Orchestrator calls: `Retrieval.fetch_articles(query)`
- Retrieval returns: List of articles (matching Source[] structure)
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#Main Query Sequence Diagram]

### Component Specifications
No specific UI component specifications for this backend story.

### File Locations
Based on the unified project structure:
- Retrieval agent implementation: `apps/api/retrieval.py`
- Shared types (if needed): `packages/shared-types/`
- Tests location: `apps/api/tests/` (following pytest conventions)
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Framework: Pytest (version 7.4.x or higher for latest async support)
- Testing approach: Unit and integration tests required
- Note: Formal Test Strategy Document is still pending as mentioned in architecture
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - Backend Testing: Pytest]

### Technical Constraints
- Backend Language: Python 3.11
- Backend Framework: FastAPI (latest)
- Deployment: Vercel Serverless Functions
- API Style: REST
- Must work within Vercel free tier limits
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Technical Summary]

### Architecture Context
- The backend consists of independent, agent-based serverless functions
- Each agent is stateless and executes on demand
- Agent-Based Modules pattern enforces separation of concerns
- Retrieval Agent connects to external News APIs as shown in architecture diagram
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Architectural Patterns]
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#High Level Architecture Diagram]

### Project Structure Notes
The monorepo structure uses:
- `apps/` directory for deployable applications
- `apps/api/` for backend serverless functions
- `packages/` for shared code
- Turborepo for monorepo management (part of Vercel boilerplate)
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Repository Structure]

### Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

#### API-Related Edge Cases
1. **API Key Invalid or Missing**
   - Return HTTP 500 with message: "News API configuration error"
   - Log error details internally but don't expose API key info to client
   - Fallback: Return empty source list with error flag

2. **API Rate Limit Exceeded**
   - Detect 429 status code from news API
   - Return HTTP 503 with retry-after header
   - Cache the error state for 60 seconds to prevent hammering
   - User message: "Service temporarily unavailable, please try again later"

3. **API Service Down/Timeout**
   - Set timeout to 10 seconds for external API calls
   - On timeout or connection error, return HTTP 503
   - Log incident for monitoring
   - Return empty source list with service unavailable message

4. **Empty Search Results**
   - Valid scenario, not an error
   - Return empty Source[] array
   - Let Orchestrator handle empty results gracefully

5. **Malformed API Response**
   - Validate response structure before parsing
   - If critical fields missing, log error and skip that article
   - Continue processing other valid articles in response
   - If entire response invalid, treat as API service error

#### Query-Related Edge Cases
1. **Empty Query String**
   - Return HTTP 400 Bad Request
   - Message: "Query parameter is required"

2. **Query Too Long (>500 characters)**
   - Truncate to 500 characters
   - Log warning about truncation
   - Process with truncated query

3. **Special Characters in Query**
   - URL-encode query properly before API call
   - Handle unicode characters correctly
   - Strip potentially dangerous characters (SQL injection patterns)

4. **Profanity or Inappropriate Content**
   - Pass through to news API (let them handle filtering)
   - Log for potential future moderation needs

#### Data Transformation Edge Cases
1. **Missing Required Fields from News API**
   - If URL missing: Skip article
   - If title missing: Use truncated article description or "Untitled"
   - Log all skipped articles for debugging

2. **Invalid URL Format**
   - Validate URLs are proper HTTP/HTTPS
   - Skip articles with malformed URLs
   - Log validation failures

3. **Duplicate Articles**
   - Deduplicate by URL
   - Keep first occurrence
   - Log duplicate removals

4. **Too Many Results**
   - Limit to maximum 20 articles per query
   - Apply limit after deduplication
   - Return most relevant based on API's relevance scoring

#### Serverless Function Constraints
1. **Memory Limit Approaching**
   - Vercel free tier: 1024 MB limit
   - Stream process results if possible
   - Implement pagination if needed

2. **Execution Timeout (10 seconds max)**
   - Set API timeout to 8 seconds
   - Reserve 2 seconds for processing
   - Return partial results if timeout approaching

3. **Cold Start Performance**
   - Lazy load heavy dependencies
   - Keep function warm with scheduled pings if needed
   - Log cold start occurrences

#### Security Considerations
1. **API Key Exposure**
   - Never log or return API keys
   - Use environment variables only
   - Validate environment config on function start

2. **Input Sanitization**
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Prevent injection attacks
   - Validate against whitelist of allowed characters

3. **Response Data Leakage**
   - Strip internal error details from client responses
   - Log full errors server-side only
   - Return generic error messages to users

### Performance Benchmarks
1. **API Response Time Targets**
   - News API response: < 2 seconds (p95)
   - Data transformation: < 500ms
   - Total Retrieval agent response: < 3 seconds
   - Cache hit response: < 100ms

2. **Throughput Targets**
   - Handle 10 concurrent requests
   - Process up to 100 articles per response
   - Transform 20 articles in under 200ms

3. **Resource Usage Targets**
   - Memory usage: < 512MB per invocation
   - CPU time: < 1 second for processing
   - Network payload: < 1MB response size
