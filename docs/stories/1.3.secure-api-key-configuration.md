# Story 1.3: Secure API Key Configuration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish and document the process for securely managing secrets,
**so that** we can protect sensitive information like API keys.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Establish and document the process for securely managing secrets using Vercel/Supabase environment variables.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1): Research and document the process for setting environment variables in Vercel for both local development (`.env` files) and production deployments.
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Investigate how Vercel environment variables are exposed to Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend.
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Create a `README.md` or a new document in `docs/` explaining the process.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 1): Create a sample secret in Vercel and access it from the backend.
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Add a new environment variable to Vercel for a dummy API key.
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create a new API endpoint in the `apps/api` that reads the secret and returns it (for testing purposes). This endpoint should be removed or secured before merging to main.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 1): Document the process in a new markdown file in the `docs/` directory.
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create `docs/secrets-management.md`.
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Write down the steps for adding, updating, and accessing secrets for both local and production environments.

## Dev Notes
This story focuses on establishing a secure way to handle secrets like API keys within the Vercel and Supabase environments.

### Platform and Infrastructure
- **Platform:** Vercel and MongoDB Atlas. Supabase is a secondary option for Authentication and File Storage if needed.
- **Secrets Management:** As per the acceptance criteria, secrets will be managed as environment variables in Vercel.
- **Backend:** The backend is composed of Python/FastAPI serverless functions located in the `apps/api` directory.
- **CI/CD:** The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### Source References
- `[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]`
- `[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]`

### Testing
- Backend testing will be conducted using `Pytest`.
- A test should be created to call the new API endpoint and verify that the secret is returned correctly.
- Note: The formal Test Strategy Document is not yet created.

## Dev Agent Record
This section is populated by the development agent during implementation

### Agent Model Used
Gemini

### Debug Log References
- `pytest --ignore=serena/test` (passed, 0 tests found)

### Completion Notes List
- Addressed QA concerns by removing the insecure test endpoint (`apps/api/test_secret.py`) and its corresponding test file (`apps/api/test_test_secret.py`).
- The `serena` project's test suite is currently broken due to a Python version incompatibility with the `sensai` library. The tests were run ignoring the `serena/test` directory.

### File List
- `docs/secrets-management.md` (created and modified)
- `apps/api/config.py` (created)
- `apps/api/test_secret.py` (deleted)
- `apps/api/test_test_secret.py` (deleted)
- `docs/stories/1.3.secure-api-key-configuration.md` (modified)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is clean, follows best practices by using Pydantic for settings management, and the documentation is clear.

### Refactoring Performed
None.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (though no formal document exists yet)
- All ACs Met: ✓

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Added unit test for the new `/api/test_secret` endpoint.
- [x] The `/api/test_secret` endpoint should be removed or secured before deploying to production. (Addressed by developer)

### Security Review
The core implementation of using environment variables for secrets is secure. However, the test endpoint `/api/test_secret` exposes a secret and is a security risk if deployed. This endpoint should be for testing purposes only and should not be present in production builds. (Addressed by developer)

### Performance Considerations
N/A

### Files Modified During Review
- `apps/api/test_test_secret.py` (created)
