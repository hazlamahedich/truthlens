#### Technology Stack
- Using Framer Motion for animations (if not present, use CSS transitions)
- Touch gestures can use react-swipeable or native touch events
- Performance monitoring through React DevTools Profiler
- Existing theme uses dark mode with vibrant accents

### Navigation Patterns
```typescript
// Desktop: Tab-based navigation
<PerspectiveTabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Perspective A (85% support)</Tab>
    <Tab>Perspective B (62% support)</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels>...</TabPanels>
</PerspectiveTabs>

// Mobile: Swipeable carousel
<SwipeableViews>
  <PerspectiveCard />
  <PerspectiveCard />
</SwipeableViews>
```

### Performance Requirements
- Animations must run at 60fps
- Use GPU-accelerated CSS transforms
- Lazy load perspective content
- Debounce swipe events
- Minimize reflows during transitions

### Visual Design Specs
- Perspective strength: Progress bar or meter (0-100%)
- Active perspective: Highlighted with theme accent color
- Transitions: 300ms ease-in-out for smooth feel
- Mobile gestures: Minimum 50px swipe distance
- Touch targets: Minimum 44x44px for accessibility

### Testing
- Test file location: `apps/web/src/components/results/__tests__/`
- Test standards: Vitest with React Testing Library
- Testing frameworks: Vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event
- Specific requirements:
  - Test navigation between perspectives
  - Test touch gesture handling
  - Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Arrow keys)
  - Test animation performance
  - Test accessibility with jest-axe
  - Test on multiple viewport sizes
  - Verify 60fps animations
