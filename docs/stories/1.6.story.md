# Story 1.6: Activate Summarization

## Status
Done



## Story
**As a** user of TruthLens,
**I want** the system to generate AI-powered summaries from real LLM calls instead of mocked data,
**so that** I can receive actual intelligent summarization of news articles retrieved by the system

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5 completion:
- Successfully implemented NewsAPI.org integration with comprehensive error handling
- Orchestrator coordinates between retrieval agent and mocked summarization/verification
- All edge cases covered including rate limiting, timeouts, and malformed responses
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements (<3s response time, <512MB memory usage)
- Pattern established: Agent-based modules with proper error handling and environment configuration

### Data Models
The Summarization agent must return data matching the Summary data model:
```typescript
interface Summary {
  format: 'debate' | 'venn_diagram';
  content: any; // Flexible structure for different formats
  sources: Source[];
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Summary]

The Summary contains Source objects from the Retrieval agent:
```typescript
interface Source {
  url: string;
  title: string;
  isVerified: boolean; // From blockchain check - set to false for now
  biasScore?: number; // Future use - can be omitted
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Source]

### API Specifications
The Summarization agent is called by the Orchestrator as shown in the sequence:
- Orchestrator calls: `Summarization.summarize_articles(list_of_articles, format='debate')`
- Summarization returns: Summary object with generated content and original sources
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#Main Query Sequence Diagram]

### Component Specifications
No specific UI component specifications for this backend story.

### File Locations
Based on the unified project structure:
- Summarization agent implementation: `apps/api/summarization.py`
- Shared types (if needed): `packages/shared-types/`
- Tests location: `apps/api/tests/` (following pytest conventions)
- Environment configuration: `apps/api/.env.example` and Vercel environment variables
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Framework: Pytest (version 7.4.x or higher for latest async support)
- Testing approach: Unit and integration tests required
- Note: Formal Test Strategy Document is still pending as mentioned in architecture
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - Backend Testing: Pytest]

### Technical Constraints
- Backend Language: Python 3.11
- Backend Framework: FastAPI (latest)
- Deployment: Vercel Serverless Functions
- API Style: REST
- Must work within Vercel free tier limits
- LLM integration must respect free tier rate limits and quotas
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Technical Summary]

### Architecture Context
- The backend consists of independent, agent-based serverless functions
- Each agent is stateless and executes on demand
- Agent-Based Modules pattern enforces separation of concerns
- Summarization Agent connects to external LLM APIs as shown in architecture diagram
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Architectural Patterns]
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#High Level Architecture Diagram]

### Project Structure Notes
The monorepo structure uses:
- `apps/` directory for deployable applications
- `apps/api/` for backend serverless functions
- `packages/` for shared code
- Turborepo for monorepo management (part of Vercel boilerplate)
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Repository Structure]

### Feature Flag Architecture
Based on the requirement for feature flagging:
- Environment variable approach: `ENABLE_REAL_SUMMARIZATION=true/false`
- Default to `false` (disabled) for safety during deployment
- Graceful fallback to mock behavior when disabled
- Easy configuration through Vercel environment variables dashboard
- Clear documentation for different environments (dev, staging, prod)

### LLM Integration Considerations
**Recommended LLM APIs for Free Tier:**
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo**: $0.002/1K tokens, good free credits for new accounts
- **Anthropic Claude**: Free tier available, excellent for summarization tasks
- **Google Gemini**: Generous free tier, good performance

**Prompt Engineering Strategy:**
- Create specific prompts for 'debate' format (pro/con structure)
- Create specific prompts for 'venn_diagram' format (comparison structure)
- Include article titles, URLs, and content excerpts in prompts
- Request structured JSON output for easier parsing
- Implement token limit management to stay within API constraints

### Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

#### LLM API-Related Edge Cases
1. **API Key Invalid or Missing**
   - Return HTTP 500 with message: "AI summarization service configuration error"
   - Log error details internally but don't expose API key info to client
   - Fallback: Return mock summary with error flag if feature flag allows

2. **LLM API Rate Limit Exceeded**
   - Detect 429 status code from LLM API
   - Implement exponential backoff with jitter (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s delays)
   - Return HTTP 503 with retry-after header if all retries exhausted
   - Cache the rate limit state for 60 seconds to prevent hammering
   - User message: "AI service temporarily busy, please try again later"

3. **LLM API Service Down/Timeout**
   - Set timeout to 12 seconds for LLM API calls (within 15s requirement)
   - On timeout or connection error, return HTTP 503
   - Log incident for monitoring with request details
   - Return structured error message with fallback options

4. **Content Filtering/Safety Violations**
   - Handle LLM API content policy violations gracefully
   - Return HTTP 400 with message: "Content cannot be summarized due to policy restrictions"
   - Log content filtering incidents for review
   - Suggest query refinement to user

5. **LLM Response Malformed**
   - Validate LLM response structure before parsing
   - If JSON parsing fails, attempt text extraction
   - If completely unusable, log error and return structured fallback
   - Never return raw LLM errors to end users

#### Feature Flag-Related Edge Cases
1. **Feature Flag Disabled**
   - Not an error scenario - normal fallback behavior
   - Return mock summary content as in previous stories
   - Log feature flag state for monitoring
   - Ensure mock content matches expected Summary data model format

2. **Feature Flag Configuration Missing**
   - Default to disabled (false) state for safety
   - Log configuration warning for operational awareness
   - Continue with mock behavior without errors

#### Content and Data Edge Cases
1. **Empty Article List**
   - Valid scenario from Retrieval agent
   - Return structured Summary with empty content
   - Handle gracefully without LLM calls
   - Message: "No articles available for summarization"

2. **Single Article vs Multiple Articles**
   - Adapt prompt templates for single vs multiple article scenarios
   - Single article: Focus on key points extraction
   - Multiple articles: Focus on synthesis and comparison
   - Maintain consistent Summary format regardless

3. **Very Large Content (Token Limits)**
   - Implement content truncation before LLM API calls
   - Prioritize article titles and opening paragraphs
   - Log truncation events for monitoring
   - Inform user when content was truncated: "Summary based on article excerpts"

4. **Non-English Content**
   - Pass through to LLM API (most support multilingual content)
   - If LLM returns non-English summary, include language note
   - Log non-English content events for analysis

#### Performance and Resource Edge Cases
1. **Summary Generation Timeout (15s requirement)**
   - Set LLM API timeout to 12 seconds
   - Reserve 3 seconds for processing and formatting
   - Return partial summary if processing takes too long
   - Log performance metrics for optimization

2. **Memory Usage Approaching Limits**
   - Vercel free tier: 1024 MB limit
   - Process articles in smaller batches if needed
   - Implement streaming response if possible
   - Monitor memory usage and implement alerts

3. **Concurrent Request Handling**
   - LLM APIs may have concurrent request limits
   - Implement request queuing with reasonable timeouts
   - Return 503 if queue is full
   - Log concurrent usage patterns for capacity planning

#### Security Considerations
1. **API Key Exposure**
   - Never log or return LLM API keys
   - Use environment variables exclusively
   - Validate environment config on function cold start
   - Implement key rotation procedures

2. **Prompt Injection Attacks**
   - Sanitize article content before including in prompts
   - Use parameterized prompt templates
   - Validate LLM responses for potential injection indicators
   - Log suspicious content patterns

3. **Sensitive Content Handling**
   - Respect LLM API content policies
   - Never store sensitive content in logs
   - Implement content sanitization if required
   - Ensure compliance with privacy regulations

### Performance Benchmarks
1. **LLM Response Time Targets**
   - LLM API response: < 12 seconds (p95)
   - Content preparation: < 1 second
   - Response parsing: < 1 second
   - Total Summarization agent response: < 15 seconds
   - Feature flag check: < 10ms

2. **Quality Targets**
   - Summary relevance: Human-readable and coherent content
   - Format compliance: Valid JSON structure matching Summary model
   - Source preservation: All original Source objects included
   - Error rate: < 5% for valid inputs

3. **Resource Usage Targets**
   - Memory usage: < 512MB per invocation
   - CPU time: < 2 seconds for processing (excluding LLM API wait time)
   - Network payload: LLM request < 2MB, response < 1MB
